  Bell and Pedre E-Commerce Project
</h1>

Bell and Pedre is a Filipino skincare startup owned by the enterprising duo, Marlon Pedregosa and Dr. Robert Bell, Ph.D., that offers products that contain biocompatible ingredients that are deemed safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration and are always “freshly made” and thus more potent.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install Project Dependencies**

    Don't forget to install the following dependencies using the following commands below. (Preferrably use yarn)

    ```sh
    # npm
    npm install
    # yarn
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Start the dev environment of the project by using this command

    ```sh
    # npm
    npm start:app
    # yarn
    yarn start:app
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    \_Note: You'll also see a third link: `http://localhost:8000/admin`\_. This gives you access to the headless content management system we are using for the project which is Netlify CMS. Learn more about using this cms in the [Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/) and here's the complete list of widgets that can be used [Netlify CMS Widget](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/)

## 📁 File Structure

The file structure is already setup for you (well not all but mostly). Please do take note of the following rules in our file structure

```
src
└─ assets
    └── css // put global stylesheets here
    └── images // put uneditable images and icon here
└─ cms
    └── preview templates // used to have preview templates in cms
└─ components // global components
└─ lambda // used for netlify identity
└─ pages // markdown and javascript pages will be placed here
└─ templates // page skeleton
```

- **Note in the templates** The components folder inside each template is for the purpose of dividing the page into component sections. Thus, remember to divide the whole page into section components and call it only in the index.js. If you have questions regarding this, ask your project manager or your co-developers

```
static
└─ admin // where the content management system is entirely managed
└─ uploads // where assets are uploaded by users of the cms
```
